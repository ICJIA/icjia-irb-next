# Death In Custody Reporting Act

<div style="margin-top: 25px"></div>

In December 2014, Congress enacted the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 (DICRA). DCRA requires states and federal law enforcement agencies to report deaths in custody to the U.S. Department of Justice. The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is the agency designated to submit Illinois death in custody reports to the Department of Justice. Illinois law enforcement and correctional officials must report information on each death that occurred in their custody for each quarter. 

Deaths in custody includes individuals:
* detained by law enforcement; 
* under arrest; 
* in the process of being arrested; 
* en route to being incarcerated or detained; of 
* incarcerated at any correctional facility, including contract facilities.

The reporting quarters are defined as January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December. Reporting deadlines are Jan. 20 (October–December), April 20 (January–March), July 20 (April–June) and October 20 (July–September). The Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collects and disseminates data through the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP).

Reporting agencies (jails, state and local police, juvenile facilities, etc.) should use this form to report any death in their custody within 20 days after the quarter in which that death occurs. Deaths in custody may be reported at any time during the quarter in which they occur.
