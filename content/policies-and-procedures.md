## Human Subject Research Training

ICJIA researchers (staff and interns) and IRB members are required to receive a Human Subjects Research certification before they can participate in or review research. ICJIA recommends completing this training through your university if possible. If you do not have access to a university's training, you can complete ICJIA's training. [To complete this training, click here](HSRTrainingCourse.pdf).
